Snake-Reloaded
==============

This is a javaScript based project for the university of applied sciences of Rosenheim.
In this project we will develop a snake revival game.

At first we had to evaluate js frameworks for games. We decided us for the crafty.js Framework, because of the collisions detection and the possibility to saves data at WebSql.
Now we are at the beginning of developing, but you can try it now.

Check it out and give us your feedback ;-)
