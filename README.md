Snake-Reloaded
==============

This is a javaScript based project for the university of applied sciences Rosenheim.
In this project we will develop a snake revival game.

At first we had to evaluate js frameworks for games. We decided us for the crafty.js Framework, because of the collision detection and the possibility to save data to WebSql.

Now we are at the beginning of development, but you can try it now.<br>
Check it out and give us your feedback ;-)
