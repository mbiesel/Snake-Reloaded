Snake-Reloaded
==============

This is a javaScript based project for the university of applied sciences Rosenheim.
In this project we will develop a snake revival game.

At first we had to evaluate js frameworks for games. We decided us for the crafty.js Framework.<br>
<b>You can download it as app for win, mac and linux form <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rj4no4671qjn9g5/AAChTV2du6kF4jkzPZug1ueba">Snake-Reloaded Apps</a></b><br>

Also we developed it only with jQuery and a third time without any library and framework to accord all.
